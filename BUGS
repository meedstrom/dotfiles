Bugs to potentially report.

- Context: melpa.org website
- Error: Package list does not load with Decentraleyes (unknown script from cdnjs.cloudflare cannot be substituted)

- Context: Passing an org table to an R block
- Error: Header row is not interpreted if there isn't a bottom hline (may be intended behavior, but bad)

- Context: Passing an org table to an R block
- Error: For columns that have text in any cell, empty cells get parsed as the empty string "", should be NA. A separate but highly related error is below.

- Context: Executing R in a src block to return a table
- Error: NA cells get filled with "nil", should just be the empty string. See also https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45601/org-babel-r-why-is-na-replaced-with-nil

- Context: Executing R code blocks in Org-mode, with session active
- Error: produces misformatted output
- User workaround: pass data frame from block to block with :var instead of using sessions. A block tangling an .Rprofile to the current directory can take care of library() calls.


- Context: Org-beautify-theme + Company-mode
- Error: see for yourself with cursor on headline


- Error: Emacs freezes on inserting "BLACK RIGHT POINTING DOUBLE TRIANGLE" with C-x 8 RET.
