WISHLIST:
- I want to symlink ~/Downloads to /tmp.
  - Stow refuses absolute paths: https://github.com/aspiers/stow/issues/51
  - Workaround: symlink to =../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp= :)


- Selective folding, discussion on https://github.com/aspiers/stow/issues/29
  - e.g. link the whole .emacs.d (fold) & only certain files in .config (unfold)
  - Stow author's own workaround: https://github.com/aspiers/ANTIFOLD
